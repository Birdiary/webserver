    consisting of various sensors such as camera, scale and microphone, but also environmental
    sensors (e.g. thermometer), birds are counted automatically and the corresponding species is
    identified. In a part of the more than 13 million German private gardens, whose area roughly
    corresponds to that of all German nature reserves, citizens set up our station. All members
    of the family become researchers and investigate biodiversity right on their doorstep. In
    addition to setting up the smart open source station in their own garden, citizens can
    evaluate, validate and compare the data collected in real time on an open data platform. In
    this way, citizens in the project not only not only inquired, but also participated in the

                    Hello dear bird friends,
                    as mentioned in our recent online community calls, we would love to meet again in person in January with everyone who has the time and energy. We want to exchange ideas, and—if there is interest—run a small hackathon. Beyond brainstorming future extensions for the citizen science project, we can work on refurbishing existing stations and refreshing the website. The exact format is still open, so feel free to send suggestions. For now, here are the key facts:
                </p>
                <p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, 24 January 2026, starting 11:00, open end (approx. 15:00/16:00)</p>
                <p><strong>Where:</strong> Geo 1 building, University of Münster, Heisenbergstr. 2, 48149 Münster, room 147 (tentative)</p>
                <p>We also want to highlight our monthly community call on Discord where we will finalize the Münster meetup agenda. The next online session takes place on Wednesday, 7 January 2026 at 19:00. Join us via our <a href="https://discord.gg/VBDy7sXgzK" target="_blank">Discord server</a>.</p>

                    Our first workshop took place at the end of April 2022, during which we assembled and set up 21
                    stations together with a diverse group of citizens.
                    <br />

                    We started with a welcome in the Geo 1 lecture hall, including a introduction lecture with all
                    participants and recommendations for the construction of the stations from Dr. Jens Wöllecke as a
                    representative of the NABU Naturschutzstation-Münsterland. Afterwards, everyone enthusiastically
                    started assembling the stations. First, all wooden parts had to be screwed together with the help of
                    instructions, after which the technology was attached. This all included tacking on roofing felt for
                    weather protection, focusing the camera, calibrating the balance and setting up the home WiFi so
                    that the station could be connected directly at home. <br />

                    During a well-deserved lunch break, all participants were able to fortify themselves with soup.
                    After lunch, the participants continued to set up the technology at four parallel workstations.
                    After a short waiting period and the solving of a few minor problems, everyone was able to
                    successfully assemble, set up and test their own station. Most of the stations are now running in
                    the gardens or balconies at home.
                    <br />

                    Have fun browsing through the videos of the birds and all other recorded data of the stations: <a

                    After 185 measuring days, we again invited the citizens with stations to a workshop to exchange
                    experiences with the smart feeding station. We met with about 15
                    people in the GEO1 building of the University of Münster. We started with a short report about the current project status. 
                    In total, more than 94,000
                    birds have already been recorded and more than 1,200,000 environmental measurements have been
                    carried out. We were surprised that 719 birds visited a station on a single day. This meant that the
                    station had to be regularly refilled with new food. After our report, the citizen-scientists presented
                    what changes they had made to the station. We were very impressed by all the
                    improvements: Different mounting options, improvement of the feed bar and output, empty food alerts,
                    secure mounting of the sensors and data storage in case of internet failure. Afterwards there was a
                    discussion, where further experiences were exchanged and possibilities for improvement were
                    discussed. After the intensive exchange of ideas, the participants went straight on to implement
                    some of the possible improvements in small groups. Defective sensors were replaced,
                    the sensors were winterized, and or Plexiglas windows were installed to control the feed level. In
                    the meantime there was a lunch break with a strengthening soup. At the end of the workshop,
                    everyone met again for a final round in which the progress was presented and wishes and goals for
                    the future were discussed. One of the wishes was to continue the lively discussion in an online forum. We have
                    therefore set up a Discord server for you:
